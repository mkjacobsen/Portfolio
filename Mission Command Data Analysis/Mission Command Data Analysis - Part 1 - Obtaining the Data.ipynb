    "# Mission Command Data Analysis - Part 1 - Obtaining the Data\n",
    "## By: Matthew Jacobsen\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating automated mission command systems, the source of data for users is the Common Operating Picture, or COP.  This satellite-type overview appears to the user similar to Google Maps (which is what we will use for this demonstration), with overlaid data of multiple types. One aspect used to assess the effectiveness of any system purporting to provide such mission command capabilities is how accurate the information presented to the user is.  There are two components to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processing of the data in order to prepare for display\n",
    "\n",
    "- Display of the data to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series, we will cover how to accomplish this using some fictional data, from the initial processing through to the conclusion generation.  While the data used is fictional, the process illustrated is the same that would be used in the actual analysis for a real system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting too much into the weed on this, let's start by defining what we are talking about.  Mission Command is, according to the US Army, \n",
    "\n",
    "*The exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to enable disciplined initiative within the commander's intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the conduct of unified land operations.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In non-military terms, it is ensuring that the commander of a given unit is able to express what he wants done, and have the remainder of the unit work to make that happen.  That said, one key component of exercising the commander's intent is to be aware of what is occurring on the battlefield.  Often, this is shown to the commander via a overhead map view with graphics displayed on top to indicate where things are happening and where he/she has resources available for tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, think something like that displayed below in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='example_cop1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> Figure 1 : Example Common Operating Picture </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the purposes of this example project, we will use the graphic above and assume that our assessment scenario is a unit (blue circles) protecting the Washington DC National Mall from invading forces (red diamonds).  The scenario has already played out and we know what happened, but we want to understand how well the mission command tool used by the defending unit aided them.  So, let's imagine we have a setup below for our tool, which we will call MCWidget. This system has an internal data type and needs to convert that into a simpler data type in order to communicate with other systems over some network.  Figure 2 shows an example flow of data for this system. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='example_dataflow.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> Figure 2 : Example Data Flow </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to assess the MCWidget, we need to know that the translations are happening correctly and that the data showed to the Soldier corresponds to that value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing and Normalizing \"Instrumented\" Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we have three data sources, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Screen Capture Information of the Soldier's Terminal (we will be using Figure 1 for this purpose)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example Network Data (Simple Text Message Format)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example Translated Data (JavaScript Object Notation Messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import our simulated data for this and see what we have. \n",
    "\n",
    "*As a note for the reader, the data used in this simulated experiment was generated by establishing a range of acceptable values and allowing all parameters to vary randomly within this range (thanks to numpy).  Additionally, the delivery time ranges will vary up to 15 seconds, with the occasional value being more than 60 seconds off.  In a similarly random fashion, some of the messages will translate incorrectly, to provide us some interesting data to analyze.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample data used for this exercise is available for download, if you would like to explore.  The files are pickled_mcwidget_data.pkl (translated data in widget) and pickled_network_data.pkl (network).  For this example, our internal data will be in JavaScript object notation (hence the json package) and our network data will string text.  The first step is to manipulate the data into a dataframe, for easier handling and numerical capabilities."
